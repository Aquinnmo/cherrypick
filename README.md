# Cherrypick

## Goal 🎯:

A fantasy hockey pick 'em game for mobile.

It will be a cross-platform application for iOS and Android. The app will be as easy to use as possible.

The user will first log-in then will be taken to their dashboard for all the leagues they are in.

They will then select a league and make all their picks for who will win the game. Eventually, it will have an update so users can choose who will cover the spread instead.

Each league will feature cummulative rankings across the entire NHL season.

Each user will pick for every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday game on the NHL schedule. This was a design choice to not overwhelm users.

## Tech Stack:

- Mobile Front-End: Flutter or React-Native (still undecided)
- Databases: Hybrid of Firebase and Supabase
- Back-End Middleware: Supabase
